            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Yash Shinde, an undergraduate student at MIT Academy of Engineering, Alandi, Pune, affiliated with Savitribai Phule Pune University. I have a keen interest in full-stack development, Android app development, and data science.I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics&Telecommunication Engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune University, where I am honing my skills in both technical and creative problem-solving. With a strong foundation in electronics, I have also developed a beginner-level proficiency in C & Python programming and am actively learning Android development to expand my expertise in software and app development.

                I am passionate about innovation and always look for ways to apply my knowledge in creative ways. A prime example of this is my project, which was selected for the prestigious Inspire Award. I developed a working model of a garbage management power plant that generates electricity from trashâ€”showcasing my ability to combine technology with sustainability.
                
                I am excited to continue learning and growing in the field of electronics and technology, with a keen interest in exploring new and innovative solutions that have a real-world impact.</p>
